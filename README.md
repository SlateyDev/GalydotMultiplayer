Godot 4 Multiplayer demonstration project

Multiplayer sample project that supports two players currently. If you try for more it will
likely break right now as it only has two spawn point right now. If I change that in the future
hopefully I will remember to update this document.

Sample was created to help GalyGames on Godot Discord server in his troubles with multiplayer
networking.

Based on https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/networking/high_level_multiplayer.html
